<h3 align="left">About Me 🌿</h3>
<p align="left">
I’m passionate about building projects that combine creativity with data. I enjoy designing applications that are both interactive and practical, exploring how data can be used and presented in engaging ways. Some of my recent projects include a recipe recommendation system using cosine similarity and KNN, and an Oxford city break website showcasing themed locations. I’m always looking to create software that is both fun and useful while continuing to learn and experiment with new technologies.
